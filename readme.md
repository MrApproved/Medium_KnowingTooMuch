# Knowing Too Much - Medium

---

This repository is made for my Medium blog post titled Knowing Too Much - The Pain & Agony Of Knowing Too Much - C# Examples

This repository contains the examples provided in the blob post itself.

The first example is how a simple ordering class may too much about what it is order and how we would have to duplicate code because of its knowledge.

The second example is a basic survey sending class which would be used to send an email to an email address but only if a specific filter is provided, we first only allow car manufacturer surveys to be sent, but then we need to extend this to allow mobile manufacturers to be used. We even go a further step and allow our surveys to be sent via SMS (we implement a console writeline for this).
